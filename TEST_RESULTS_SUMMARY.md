### ❌ Failing Packages (4/12)

1. **pkg/storage** - ❌ FAIL
   - **Issue**: Edge case test failures
   - **Details**: RefStore tests for empty ref names and error messages
   - **Impact**: Minor - edge cases only, core functionality works

2. **api** - ❌ FAIL
   - **Issue**: Multiple test failures
   - **Details**: 
     - Time travel features not working as expected
     - Git workflow tests failing (merge operations)
     - File operations returning 404
   - **Impact**: Major - API functionality affected

3. **cluster** - ❌ FAIL
   - **Issue**: State persistence test failing
   - **Details**: Cluster state not being saved/loaded correctly
   - **Impact**: Moderate - clustering features affected

4. **examples/basic** - ❌ BUILD FAIL
   - **Issue**: API changes not reflected in examples
   - **Details**: Using old API methods (Init, wrong parameters)
   - **Impact**: Documentation/examples outdated

## Test Coverage Summary

### High Coverage (>80%)
- pkg/workspace: 86.3%
- pool: 96.9%

### Good Coverage (60-80%)
- pkg/refs: 60.5%
- auth: 63.1%
- container: 70.1%

### Improved Coverage (50-60%)
- pkg/storage: 59.8% (improved from 53.2%)
- pkg/object: 54.4%

### Low Coverage (<50%)
- api: Low due to test failures
- cluster: Low due to test failures
- main: 32.9%
- importexport: 0% (but tests pass)

## Key Issues to Address

### Priority 1: API Test Failures
- Fix time travel endpoint implementation
- Fix merge operation (missing common ancestor)
- Fix file operations returning 404
- Address race condition with metrics

### Priority 2: Update Examples
- Remove repo.Init() calls
- Update WriteFile parameters (remove mode)
- Update Commit parameters (remove options)
- Fix Merge parameters

### Priority 3: Storage Edge Cases
- Handle empty ref names properly
- Fix error message consistency
- Update RefManagerAdapter implementation

### Priority 4: Cluster State
- Fix state persistence mechanism
- Ensure repositories are properly saved/loaded

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix examples to use current API
   - Address API test failures
   - Fix cluster state persistence

2. **Short Term**:
   - Improve API test coverage once fixed
   - Add more integration tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Long Term**:
   - Achieve >80% coverage for all packages
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Add stress tests for concurrent operations

## Conclusion

The core functionality is working well with 66% of packages passing tests. The main issues are in the API layer and examples, which need to be updated to reflect the recent architectural changes. The storage abstraction work has improved test coverage and the core packages (object, refs, workspace) are stable.
