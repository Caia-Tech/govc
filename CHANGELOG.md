## Development Philosophy

govc follows these principles during development:

1. **Test-Driven**: Every fix includes comprehensive tests
2. **Incremental**: Small, focused releases
3. **Transparent**: All changes documented
4. **Community-Focused**: User feedback drives priorities

## Version Numbering
