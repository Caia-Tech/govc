# 🚧 govc Development Status

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project is under active development and subject to significant changes.**

## Current Status: Alpha / Experimental

govc (Go Version Control) is an experimental, memory-first version control system that reimagines how we interact with code history. While the core functionality is operational, **this project is in active development** and should be treated as experimental software.

### What This Means

- **API Stability**: APIs may change without notice between versions
- **Feature Completeness**: Not all planned features are implemented
- **Testing Coverage**: While we maintain comprehensive tests, edge cases may still exist
- **Performance**: Optimization is ongoing; performance characteristics may vary
- **Documentation**: Documentation is evolving alongside the codebase

## 🧪 Extensive Testing Architecture

govc employs a multi-layered testing strategy to ensure reliability even during rapid development:

### Testing Layers

1. **Unit Tests** (`*_test.go`)
   - Coverage: ~52% and growing
   - Focus: Individual component functionality
   - Status: ✅ All passing

2. **Integration Tests** (`api/*_test.go`)
   - Coverage: Comprehensive API testing
   - Focus: End-to-end workflows
   - Status: ✅ All critical paths tested

3. **Storage Layer Tests** (`pkg/storage/*_test.go`)
   - Coverage: 58.3%
   - Focus: Data integrity and persistence
   - Status: ✅ All adapters tested

4. **Memory-First Tests**
   - Special focus on in-memory operations
   - Parallel reality testing
   - Time-travel functionality verification

### Recent Test Improvements (August 2024)

- ✅ Fixed all critical test failures
- ✅ Resolved storage adapter inconsistencies
- ✅ Fixed stash/checkout/time-travel operations
- ✅ Eliminated deadlocks in concurrent operations
- ✅ Improved test reliability and determinism
- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Implemented security middleware
- ✅ Added structured logging with correlation IDs
- ✅ Integrated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## 🔄 Continuous Evolution

### What's Changing

   - Enhanced parallel reality capabilities
   - Improved time-travel functionality
   - Security hardening and validation

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Comprehensive input validation
   - Path traversal protection
   - Brute force protection
   - Rate limiting implementation

### What's Stable

1. **Core Concepts**
   - Memory-first architecture
   - Parallel realities concept
   - Time-travel functionality

2. **Basic Operations**
   - Repository creation and management
   - Basic version control operations
   - File and commit management
