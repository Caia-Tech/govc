- Improved scalability

### 6. Stream Processing (`pkg/optimize/stream_processor.go`)

**Features:**
- **Chunked Processing**: Process large data in chunks
- **Pipeline Processing**: Chain multiple operations efficiently
- **Minimal Memory Usage**: Stream data without loading entirely in memory
- **Parallel Processing**: Process chunks concurrently

**Benefits:**
- Handle large files without memory issues
- Faster processing through parallelization
- Reduced memory footprint

## Performance Manager Integration

The `PerformanceManager` (`performance_manager.go`) integrates all optimizations:

```go
// Initialize global performance manager
govc.InitPerformanceManager()

// Use optimized operations
repo.OptimizedAdd(path, content)
repo.BatchAdd(files)
repo.OptimizedCommit(message)
```

## Performance Testing

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
# Create baseline
./scripts/performance_regression_test.sh baseline

# Run regression tests
./scripts/performance_regression_test.sh test

# Update baseline
./scripts/performance_regression_test.sh update

# Generate HTML report
./scripts/performance_regression_test.sh report
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
# Run comprehensive quality analysis
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# Run performance profiling
./scripts/optimize-performance.sh
```

## Benchmarks

Run benchmarks to measure performance:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Run specific optimization benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./pkg/optimize

# Generate CPU profile
go test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -bench=. ./pkg/storage
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.prof

# Generate memory profile
go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=. ./pkg/storage
go tool pprof -http=:8081 mem.prof
```

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks various performance metrics:

- **Memory**: Allocations, GC cycles, pool efficiency
- **Concurrency**: Active goroutines, blocked operations
- **Storage**: Cache hits/misses, compression ratio, deduplication rate
- **Database**: Connection pool usage, query cache effectiveness
- **API**: Response times, cache hit ratio, rate limiting

Access metrics via:

```go
metrics := GlobalPerformanceManager.GetMetrics()
report := GlobalPerformanceManager.PerformanceReport()
```

## Configuration Tuning

### Memory Pool
```go
pool := optimize.NewMemoryPool()
// Adjust buffer sizes based on workload
```

### Concurrency
```go
limiter := optimize.NewConcurrentLimiter(runtime.NumCPU() * 2)
// Adjust based on system resources
```

### Caching
```go
cache := optimize.NewLRUCache(10000) // Adjust size
// Configure TTL based on data freshness requirements
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Pooled Resources**: Always use memory pools for temporary buffers
2. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations when possible
3. **Cache Aggressively**: Cache computed results and frequently accessed data
4. **Limit Concurrency**: Use limiters to prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Monitor Metrics**: Regularly check performance metrics for anomalies
6. **Profile Regularly**: Use pprof to identify bottlenecks
7. **Test Performance**: Run regression tests before major releases

## Performance Goals

- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for typical operations
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for API calls
- **Throughput**: > 10,000 operations/second
- **GC Pause**: < 10ms maximum pause time
- **CPU Usage**: < 50% under normal load

## Continuous Improvement

Performance optimization is an ongoing process:

1. **Monitor**: Track metrics in production
2. **Profile**: Identify bottlenecks regularly
3. **Optimize**: Focus on highest-impact areas
4. **Test**: Verify improvements don't cause regressions
5. **Document**: Keep this guide updated

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
- Check for memory leaks using pprof
- Verify pools are returning buffers
- Review cache sizes

### Slow Operations
- Profile CPU usage
- Check for lock contention
- Review database query performance

### High Latency
- Check network conditions
- Review API cache effectiveness
- Verify circuit breaker status
