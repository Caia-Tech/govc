# Infrastructure Configuration Testing with govc

This example demonstrates how govc's memory-first approach revolutionizes infrastructure configuration management.

## The Problem

Traditional infrastructure testing faces these challenges:
- Changes affect production immediately
- Testing requires duplicate environments (expensive)
- Rollback is slow and risky
- Can't test multiple configurations simultaneously

## The govc Solution

With govc's parallel realities, you can:
1. Test multiple configurations in isolated universes
2. Measure performance without affecting production
3. Instantly switch between configurations
4. Roll back changes by switching branches (instant)

## Example: Load Balancer Configuration

The `config_testing.go` example shows:
- Testing 3 different load balancer algorithms simultaneously
- Each test runs in its own reality (no interference)
- Performance metrics collected in isolation
- Best configuration selected automatically

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Risk**: Tests run in memory, production untouched
- **Parallel Testing**: Test N configurations in the time of 1
- **Instant Rollback**: Just switch branches
- **Audit Trail**: Every configuration change is versioned

## Running the Example

```bash
go run config_testing.go
```

Output shows each configuration's performance and automatically selects the best one.

## Real-World Applications

- A/B testing infrastructure changes
- Capacity planning with different configurations
- Disaster recovery scenario testing
- Security configuration validation
