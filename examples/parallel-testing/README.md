# Parallel Universe Testing with govc

This example demonstrates how govc's memory-first design enables true parallel testing where each test runs in its own isolated reality.

## The Problem with Traditional Testing

In traditional testing:
- Tests that modify state must run sequentially
- Database tests need cleanup/rollback
- File system tests can conflict
- Parallel tests require complex isolation

## The govc Solution: Test Isolation Through Parallel Realities

With govc, each test runs in its own branch (reality):
- Tests can modify the same files without conflicts
- No cleanup needed - just discard the branch
- True parallelism - 100 tests take the same time as 1
- Complete isolation - tests literally exist in different universes

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Database Configuration Tests
Three tests modify `database.conf` differently:
- Test 1: Scales up to 5 replicas
- Test 2: Scales down to 0 replicas  
- Test 3: Switches to backup host

Normally these would conflict. With govc, they run simultaneously in different realities.

### 2. Integration Test Suite
Traditional approach:
```
TestUserAuth     → TestDataMigration → TestAPI → TestCache (sequential, 4x time)
```

govc approach:
```
TestUserAuth     ─┐
TestDataMigration ├─→ All complete simultaneously (1x time)
TestAPI          ─┤
TestCache        ─┘
```

## Performance Impact

The benchmark shows creating 100 parallel realities takes microseconds, not seconds. This is only possible because govc is memory-first - no disk I/O for branch creation.

## Running the Examples

```bash
go test -v parallel_test.go
go test -bench=. parallel_test.go
```

## Real-World Benefits

1. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Run entire test suites in parallel
2. **Load Testing**: Test different configurations simultaneously
3. **Chaos Engineering**: Each chaos scenario in its own reality
4. **Development**: Developers can test without affecting each other

> "When branches are just pointers in memory rather than directories on disk, 
> parallel testing becomes trivial rather than complex."
