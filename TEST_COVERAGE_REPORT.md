# govc Test Coverage Report

## Overall Coverage: 45.9%

### Package Breakdown:

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| govc (main) | 29.5% | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| ai/embeddings | 82.9% | ✅ Excellent |
| ai/llm | 0.8% | ❌ Critical - needs tests |
| ai/search | 32.8% | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| pkg/object | 54.8% | 🔶 Acceptable |
| pkg/refs | 60.5% | 🔶 Good |
| pkg/storage | 60.4% | 🔶 Good |

### Test Files Created:

1. **govc_test.go** - Integration tests for library API
2. **basic_test.go** - Core functionality tests
3. **simple_unit_test.go** - Unit tests for basic operations
4. **export_test.go** - Export functionality tests
5. **ai_features_test.go** - AI feature tests with mocks

### Key Findings:

#### ✅ Well-Tested Areas:
- AI embeddings (82.9%) - Semantic search functionality
- Storage layer (60.4%) - Object storage
- Reference management (60.5%) - Branch/tag handling
- Object model (54.8%) - Core git objects

#### ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention:
- Main package (29.5%) - Core repository operations
- AI search (32.8%) - Semantic search engine
- AI LLM (0.8%) - Language model integration

#### 🐛 Implementation Issues Found:
1. Export functionality not fully implemented
2. HEAD reference initialization issues
3. Parallel reality naming inconsistencies
4. Missing Import() method

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Priority**: 
   - Add tests for AI/LLM package (currently at 0.8%)
   - Fix Export implementation or update tests
   - Initialize HEAD reference properly in new repositories

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Increase main package coverage to >50%
   - Improve AI search coverage to >50%
   - Fix test assertions to match actual behavior

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Increase pkg/* coverage to >70%
   - Add integration tests for distributed features
   - Add performance benchmarks

### Test Execution:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test -cover ./ai/embeddings

# Generate detailed coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Notes:

- The embedding system has excellent coverage (82.9%) despite being over-engineered
- Core packages have decent coverage (>50%)
- AI features need more test coverage, especially LLM integration
- Some tests are failing due to implementation gaps, not test issues
