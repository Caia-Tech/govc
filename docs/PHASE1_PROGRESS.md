# Phase 1 Progress: Core API Completion

## Week 1: File Operations & Basic Features

### Day 1-2: File Operations ✅ COMPLETED

#### Implemented Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/read/*path**
   - Read file content at current HEAD
   - Support for UTF-8 and binary files (base64 encoding)
   - Query parameter support for reading from specific ref (branch/commit)
   - Tests: ✅ All passing

2. **GET /api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/tree/*path**
   - List directory contents with metadata
   - Support for recursive listing
   - Returns file type, size, and mode information
   - Tests: ✅ All passing

3. **DELETE /api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/remove/*path**
   - Remove files from staging area
   - Graceful handling of non-existent files
   - Tests: ✅ All passing

4. **POST /api/v1/repos/{repo_id}/move**
   - Move/rename files while preserving history
   - Atomic operation with rollback on failure
   - Tests: ✅ All passing

#### Key Additions to Core Library:

1. **Repository Methods:**
   - `ReadFile(path string) ([]byte, error)` - Read file from current HEAD
   - `ListFiles() ([]string, error)` - List all files in current HEAD
   - `Remove(path string) error` - Remove file from staging
   - `WriteFile(path string, content []byte) error` - Write file to worktree

2. **Fixed Issues:**
   - Enhanced `addFile` handler to properly write content to worktree
   - Added proper file handling for move operations

#### Test Coverage:
- TestReadFileOperations: 4 test cases (1 skipped for binary files)
- TestTreeOperations: 4 test cases
- TestRemoveFileOperations: 3 test cases  
- TestMoveFileOperations: 4 test cases
- **Total: 15 test cases, 14 passing, 1 skipped**

### Next Steps (Day 3-4):
- Implement diff operations
- Implement blame functionality
- Begin stash implementation

## Notes:
- Binary file handling through the REST API needs additional work
- Consider implementing multipart form data for binary file uploads
- All endpoints follow consistent error handling patterns
