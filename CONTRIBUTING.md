# Contributing to govc

Thank you for your interest in contributing to govc! As an actively evolving project, we welcome contributions while maintaining high standards for code quality and testing.

## üöß Development Status

**Important**: govc is in alpha stage. This means:
- APIs may change between versions
- Your contributions might need updates as the project evolves
- We prioritize learning and experimentation over stability
- Breaking changes are documented but may happen frequently

## üìã Before You Contribute

1. **Read the Documentation**:
   - [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) - Current project status
   - [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) - Testing requirements
   - [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) - Current API documentation

2. **Check Existing Work**:
   - Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Caia-Tech/govc/issues)
   - Review [pull requests](https://github.com/Caia-Tech/govc/pulls)
   - Join [discussions](https://github.com/Caia-Tech/govc/discussions)

3. **Understand the Architecture**:
   - Memory-first design principles
   - Storage abstraction layers
   - Testing requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Git
- Make (optional but recommended)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Caia-Tech/govc.git
cd govc

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests to verify setup
go test ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

**All contributions MUST include tests**. We maintain multiple testing layers:

### 1. Unit Tests
For new functions or methods:
```go
func TestYourFeature(t *testing.T) {
    // Test implementation
}
```

### 2. Integration Tests
For API changes or complex features:
```go
func TestYourFeatureIntegration(t *testing.T) {
    // End-to-end test
}
```

### 3. Benchmarks
For performance-critical code:
```go
func BenchmarkYourFeature(b *testing.B) {
    // Benchmark implementation
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific package
go test ./pkg/storage/...

# With coverage
make test-coverage

# Benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...
```

## üìù Contribution Process

### 1. Small Changes (Bug Fixes, Documentation)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-description`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Run all tests: `go test ./...`
6. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "fix: clear description"`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin fix-description`
8. Create a Pull Request

### 2. Large Changes (New Features, Architecture)

1. **Discuss First**: Open an issue or discussion
2. Wait for maintainer feedback
3. Follow the small changes process
4. Be prepared for multiple review rounds

## üíª Code Standards

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

```go
// Package comment explains the purpose
package storage

// ExportedType is documented with godoc comments
type ExportedType struct {
    // ExportedField is documented
    ExportedField string
    
    privateField string
}

// Method does something and is documented
func (e *ExportedType) Method() error {
    // Implementation
    return nil
}
```

### Error Handling

Always handle errors explicitly:

```go
// Good
data, err := ReadFile(path)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("reading file %s: %w", path, err)
}

// Bad
data, _ := ReadFile(path)  // Never ignore errors
```

### Testing Patterns

Use table-driven tests:

```go
tests := []struct {
    name    string
    input   string
    want    string
    wantErr bool
}{
    {"empty input", "", "", true},
    {"valid input", "test", "TEST", false},
}

for _, tt := range tests {
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
        got, err := YourFunction(tt.input)
        if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
            t.Errorf("YourFunction() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
        }
        if got != tt.want {
            t.Errorf("YourFunction() = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
        }
    })
}
```

## üìä Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
